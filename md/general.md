## Questions!

These questions are all anonymous. They're separate forms so that we can't tie the responses together. We'll talk about this kind of thing in one of the later lectures in this course.

We're going to pause the lecture for you to fill these in.

## Course Outline:

This course focuses on using programming as a way to solve problems, to amplify your storytelling, and to give you a means of creative expression. It's for people in fields where mathematics isn't a significant part of your work. Very roughly, it means that it's not for computer science or engineering people, not that they're not welcome, but they weren't the target while designing this course. If you're an arborist, an architect, an artist, a botanist, a journalist, a librarian, linguist, a potter, or a xylophone player, then this course will be useful for you.

Programming is a vocational skill, a branch of philosophy, a culture, and the glue that holds the modern world together. By the end of this course you will have the philosophical tools needed to **design solutions** and the **technical skill** to implement them.

In the same way that being able to hold a pen doesn't make you a writer, being able to type code doesn't make you a programmer. We'll learn how to manipulate symbols (type code), what those symbols mean, and how to decide which symbols to type in the first place. We'll learn simple logic and strategies for decomposing problems. We'll learn about the history and culture of computers in general, and in art and architecture.

You'll learn these ideas and skills two sections.

1. The first will be becoming proficient in the [Python](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)>).
1. The second will be the Open Data Project: a data exploration, analysis and story telling task.

## Course Communication

### Course website

[design-computing.github.io](https://design-computing.github.io/)

This has everything you need to know. We update it a lot, so keep looking. [ctrl]+[d] will bookmark it.

This is where you are right now!

### Course repositories

We've broken the course into three repos. (Who wants to say _repository_ when all the cool people say _repo_?)

1. [course](https://github.com/Design-Computing/course) This is where the active bit of the course lives. This contains the code that checks your answers, that means that you can see what's going on under the covers.
1. [me](https://github.com/Design-Computing/me) This is where _you_ write code, except it isn't! Sounds tricky doesn't it. If everyone wrote their code in the same place then it'd get messy. You write your code in _your own_ personal copy of this repo. In git language, we call copy a _[fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo)_.
1. [Design-Computing.github.io](https://github.com/Design-Computing/Design-Computing.github.io) This has the code that _we_ need to run the course, including the words that you're reading now. You don't ever _need_ to look at the code underneath all this, but it's there if you ever wanted to look. That's the magic of open source!

### Teams

You can ask questions here, and answer each other's problems. We _really_ like you to ask questions here. If you're stuck on a problem, the odds are that lots of other people are. Because everyone can see the question we can answer it once and help lots of people at the same time. We'll talk about how to write a _good_ question in class.

Announcements and updates to the course will be there too, so keep a regular eye on it.

There's a [template here](questionTemplate) to help you write good questions.

Teams is good for general chit-chat about comp design and computing, you know the drill by now.

### Email

Email is uncool, but sometimes it's necessary. If you absolutely need to email then:

- Ben Doherty: b.doherty@unsw.edu.au

_BUT_ before you email, if it's something to do with the course, make sure you use [this template](email_template)
