# Design Computing 2019

#### CODE1161

## Course Outline:

This course focuses on using programming as a way to solve problems, to amplify your storytelling, and to give you a means of creative expression. It's for people in non-computer and engineering science fields.

Programming is simultaneously a vocational skill, a branch of philosophy, a culture, and the glue that holds the modern world together. By the end of this course you will have the philosophical tools needed to **design solutions** and the **technical skill** to implement them.

In the same way that being able to hold a pen doesn't make you a writer, being able to type code doesn't make you a programmer. We'll learn how to manipulate symbols (type code), what those symbols mean, and how to decide which symbols to type in the first place. We'll learn simple logic and strategies for decomposing problems. We'll learn about the history and culture of computers in general, and in art and architecture.

You'll learn these ideas and skills three sections.

1. The first will be becoming proficient in the [Python](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)>).
1. Second is will be a machine learning project which uses your newfound problem solving and programming skills.
1. The third section will be the Open Data Project: a data exploration, analysis and story telling task.

## Course Communication

### Course website

[design-computing.github.io](https://design-computing.github.io/)

This has everything you need to know. We update it a lot, so keep looking. [ctrl]+[d] will bookmark it.

### Course repositories

We've broken the course into three repos. (Who wants to say _repository_ when all the cool people say _repo_?)

1. [course](https://github.com/Design-Computing/course) This is where the active bit of the course lives. This contains the code that checks your answers, that means that you can see what's going on under the covers.
1. [me](https://github.com/Design-Computing/me) This is where _you_ write code, except it isn't! Sounds tricky doesn't it. If everyone wrote their code in the same place then it'd get messy. You write your code in your own personal copy of this repo. In git language, we call copy a _[fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo)_.
1. [Design-Computing.github.io](https://github.com/Design-Computing/Design-Computing.github.io) This has the code that _we_ need to run the course, including the words that you're reading now. You don't ever _need_ to look at the code underneath all this, but it's there if you ever wanted to look. That's the magic of open source!

### Piazza

This is a forum for your questions about the course. You can ask questions here, and answer each other's problems. We _really_ like you to ask questions here. If you're stuck on a problem, the odds are that lots of other people are. Because everyone can see the question we can answer it once and help lots of people at the same time. We'll talk about how to write a good question in class.

Announcements and updates to the course will be there too, so keep a regular eye on it.

We need to invite you to join the piazza class, so make sure that you finish the week 1 exercises so that we know about you.

There's a [template here](piazzaQuestionTemplate.md) to help you write good piazza questions.

### Email

Email is uncool, but sometimes it's necessary. If you absolutely need to email then:

- Ben Doherty: b.doherty@unsw.edu.au
- Aiden Ray: z3460907@ad.unsw.edu.au

_BUT_ before you email, if it's something to do with the course, make sure you use [this template](email_template)

### Slack

Slack's for general chit-chat about comp design and computing. We'll invite you to this too. The team is here https://unsw-code.slack.com
