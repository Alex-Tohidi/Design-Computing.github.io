What to do this week:

### Exercises

There's a break in the weekly exercises this week for you to get moving on your data project. That means that you have _more time_ to catch up. So if you're not right up to date, don't stop!

(I've been working on this a bit so there are a couple of things that need a tweak.)

Now that you know how to do shared sessions, practice pair programming to work together on your exercises.

## Data Project

If you don't have a dataset, get in touch as soon as you can!

If you do, work through the example file with it to get a feel for the data. Start to think about what you could do with it.

What are the columns like? What _type_ of data are they? `int`s or dates? or strings?

What opportunities for grouping are there? Categories? Group by day, month, year, day of week, time of day?

If you had infinite time, what else could you join to this dataset to make it even more interesting?

#### Example file

[This file](https://github.com/Design-Computing/course/blob/master/week7/basic_pandas.ipynb) should get you up and running with exploring your data.

Just point the file path in the cell that loads the data to your data and start working through it. It's not going to work straight out of the box. It'll need to be modified a lot, but it's the bones of a good set up.

I'd like you to present your data to at least 1, ideally 2 of your peers before Wednesday. I'm going to ask them what your data is about and what was interesting about it to them.
