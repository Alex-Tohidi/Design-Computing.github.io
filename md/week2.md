# Week 1 Lab: Everything Python in a few hours

## Introduction

- This week we will get an overview of all the components of the Python syntax. Theoretically, you will be able to do **any** programming task after this week ;-).

- More details about the development environment.

- How to ask questions and the three step process to general problem solving.

# Clinic

Getting the basics right is the key to being able to do this course. It's vital that you finish week 1's work as soon as possible.

If you didn't get a suite of beautiful green ticks last week, then the first thing we're going to do is fix that for you.

### _Your Name_

A lot of people are still called _Your Name_. Let's fix that first!

Your name in the faces means that we can learn your names faster. It also means that when you push your work to GitHub and we mark it, we know who has done the work. If you don't give us the information, the _repo_ has marks, but _you_ don't.

The information is in your `me` repo, the file is `aboutMe.yml`. Mine looks like:

```yml
name: Ben Doherty
studentNumber: z1234567
officialEmail: b.doherty@unsw.edu.au
contactEmail: # don't add anything to this line
  firstBit: ben # the indent is important, as is the space after the :
  otherBit: notionparallax.co.uk # this avoids spam, the @ is implied
```

The `contactEmail:` line is blank because it's before an indented block. That'll all make sense by the end of this week, but for now, go with it. (if you want to read more about YAML, [here's a link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML))

Update the file with your info, save, stage, write a good message, commit, and push. Then wait 30 seconds and check if your info shows up on the [website](https://design-computing.github.io/).

### Can't get a wall of ticks?

#### Mac person?

We feel your pain, let's all get together at the start of the lab to work it out. A far as I can tell, [these tips will fix you up](https://design-computing.github.io/md/week1#are-you-a-mac-user).

There might be a more elegant fix, but at least to begin with, it should fix the biggest problems.

# How to do the exercises

Each file starts with a section of writing, wrapped in """triple quotes""". It tells you what the we want you to do. There's another one in each function that is more specific.

```python
"""Modify each function until the tests the_answer = None

    return the_answer.

The command to run the tests is:

python ../course/week2/tests.py


In each function, where you see:

    the_answer = None

replace None with the actual answer.

"""
```

This block is an example of a completed exercise function. It has a name, `add_1`; an argument, `a_number`; a `"""docstring"""`; some code; and a `return` statement. Take a look and I'll explain it all below.

```python
def add_1(a_number):
    """Return a number that is 1 bigger than number given.

    This isn't a trick!

    This is an example function to get you started.
    Run the tests now and this one should go green. Free marks!
    """
    the_answer = a_number + 1

    return the_answer
```

### Name

Like you have a name, that you've just added to your `aboutMe.yml` file, this function has a name too; it's `add_1`. You need to know a function's name to be able to _call_ it.

### Argument or Arguments

The function takes in some values to do something with. In this case the argument is called `a_number`. You can call it anything that's a [valid variable name](https://realpython.com/python-variables/#:~:text=Officially%2C%20variable%20names%20in%20Python,name%20cannot%20be%20a%20digit.).

People sometimes get confused about where the values come from. The argument name is an alias for the value that's _passed_ in.

If you were making a sandwich function, the code might be:

```python
def make_sandwich(filling):
  print( "==========\n"
        f" {filling}\n"
         "==========\n")
```

![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/sandwich.png)

or in an even simpler example:

```python
def double(x):
  return x + x
```

When we a function to run, the programmer language for that is to "_call_" it, so if we _call_ these: `double(4)` gives `8` and `make_sandwich("cheese")` will print:

```
==========
  cheese
==========
```

The argument name wraps the incoming value so that you can think _abstractly_ about it.

### `"""docstring"""`

The text in `"""triple quotes"""` is called the docstring; it's important in python functions because it explains to auto-documenters what your function does, and it also shows as context help in your editor.

### Code

This is the python that does the work. We'll learn a lot about this bit during the course.

### `return` statement

This is a _keyword_. If arguments put values in, `return` gives a value back.

```python
half_a_dozen = double(3)
```

`half_a_dozen` will end up as `6` because `double` has `return`ed that to it.

### Engineering Flowchart

In exercise 3, the `fix_it` function asks about an engineeringFlowchart. This is it:

## Homework

1. Finish this week's exercises: 0&ndash;3. Remember to _push_ to GitHub

1. We're going to teach you python, we promise, but why not make the most of the rest of the world?

   Doing many tutorials on the same subject will explain ideas in different ways. The two we'd recommend are:

   1. [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc:): Do chapters 1&ndash;5

   1. [Codecademy: Learn Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) (This is python 2, the python 3 course is paid, but the content is basically the same.)

   These will give you different perspectives on this python stuff. The more times you cover the material, the better it'll bed down in your brain.

## Optional Reading:

- **Victor, B.** (2011). _[Up and Down the Ladder of Abstraction](http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/)_.

  A great read that will help you _think_ like a programmer.

- **Doherty, B.** (2016). _[A thinking trick for beginner programmers - Ghetto TDD](https://notionparallax.co.uk/2016/a-thinking-trick-for-beginner-programmers)_.

  Another way of explaining the test process.

- **Noll, A. M.** (1967). _[The digital computer as a creative medium](http://noll.uscannenberg.org/Art%20Papers/Creative%20Medium.pdf)_. IEEE Spectrum, 4(10), 89â€“95.

  A really old paper, people have been thinking about this stuff for a _long_ time now.
