# Week 1 Lab: Python and Your Dev Environment

## Introduction

This week's lab is in two parts. One's administrative and the other's creative. But don't let that lull you into thinking that the first part is boring! Managing your dev environment is something you'll keep doing for your whole career. (_dev_ is short for _development_.) You can think of it like a chef choosing and sharpening their knives&mdash;it's a never ending process.

Part one will involve a lot of doing things without really knowing why. It'll be confusing, but it will get you going, then you can look back and understand.

Part two is a low-barrier-to-entry way to start flexing your computational thinking.

## Your dev environment

Part of your dev environment is going to be on your computer, and some of it will be in the cloud.

You'll year us use the word _local_ to mean _on your computer_ and _remote_ to mean _in the cloud_.

### Cloud environment

**But first:** You might have an email address that's like `unicorn.sparkles@gmail.com` or `i_am_so_cool03@hotmail.com`. If you do, think about writing that on your CV. Do you want Norman Foster to read that?

Your email address, for better or worse, is your central identity. Don't use your university or work email address to sign up for things, you'll still be using your GitHub account long after you've severed ties with that organisation. Get a good personal email address, and look after it.

#### Get a GitHub account!

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com/) and **Sign Up**.
2. Fill in your real name
3. Upload a photo of your face as your profile picture. We need this so that we can work out who you are.

Once you've done those steps, you can refresh this page and you should see yourself at the bottom!

#### Get a StackOverflow account!

1. Go to [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/) and **Sign Up**.

You'll need this to help you out. As a way of 'paying' for that help, it's good manners to upvote the questions and answers that you find useful. Being a programmer without SO is unthinkable!

### Steps to set up your dev environment

We'll go through this together, but if you need to setup a new dev environment then these are the steps:

1. Git:
   1. Go to https://git-scm.com/downloads and download the latest git
   1. Install git with all the default values, except make vs code be the default editor
1. Anaconda:
   1. Download anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section get the Python 3.7 version
   1. install it with default values _except_ tick the option to **Add Anaconda to my PATH**, tick that and the text will go red.
   1. Be patient
   1. Open anaconda navigator
   1. Click install on the VS Code box, be patient again
1. VS Code

   1. Open VS Code, bask in its glory
   1. inside VS Code, type [ctrl]+[`] that's a backtick, it's to the left of 1 on most keyboards. That will pop up a section at the bottom of the screen. We'll call that your _terminal_.
   1. Your prompt should say something like:

      `C:\Users\ben>` except where mine says `ben` yours will say something else, maybe it'll be your name, maybe it'll be something boring?

      Whatever it is, now we need to write some magic spells.

1. Getting your content
   1. type `mkdir 1161`
   1. then `cd 1161`
   1. then `git clone https://github.com/Design-Computing/CODE1161-2019 course`
1. Clone

   1. Go to https://github.com/Design-Computing/me and [fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) yourself a copy of the _me_ repo
   1. Then, back in the terminal `git clone https://github.com/`_your name_`/me.git` We talked about it in the presentation.
   1. now type `dir` you should get something that looks like:

   ```
   C:\Users\ben\1161>dir

   01/06/2019  16:20    <DIR>          .
   01/06/2019  16:20    <DIR>          ..
   01/06/2019  16:20    <DIR>          course
   01/06/2019  16:20    <DIR>          org
   01/06/2019  16:20    <DIR>          me
               0 File(s)              0 bytes
               5 Dir(s)  308,818,493,440 bytes free

   C:\Users\ben\1161>
   ```

1. Finish up

   1. Last thing: type `cd course` and then `./startup.bat` and press [enter] this will install some libraries and extensions that will make your life easier/more fun. If you've got a mac, call someone over to help.

1. Prepare your workspace.

   1. Get out a pen and notebook
   1. Take a deep breath
   1. Say "You've got this" to yourself
   1. Smile
   1. go to `File`&rarr;`Open Folder` and then choose `me`
   1. Look at all those neat folder ready for you to work on!

1. Now you're ready to start the lab for real!

## My first programming

In this task you're going to do a full cycle of work.

1. Think
1. Test
1. Do
1. Save
1. Test
1. Commit
1. Push
1. Test

That's a lot to think about but it'll become easy soon. If we break that down individually:

#### Think

This is the _most_ important thing. Spending a long time doing the wrong thing is painful. So thinking means discussing with your peers, drawing diagrams, closing your eyes and dancing out the steps, whatever helps you understand.

Each week has a folder. It'll show up in the tree view on the left. We're in week 1, so look in the folder `week1`.

We're interested in `exercise1.py` and `readme.md` I like to have them both open at the same time.

In `exercise1.py` look at the instructions in the _doc-string_. That's the bit at the top of the file.

```
"""Your very first python program!

TODO: write a python script that first prints "Hello world!"
"""
```

Now do some thinking.

#### Test

In this course, at least to begin with, the tests are already written for you. They check if your code does what it's supposed to do. To run the tests, you write, at the terminal:

> `python ../course/week1/tests.py`

Then press enter.

Resist the urge to copy and paste this, you're going to be doing it a lot, and it'll be much better if you just learn to type it.

The test produce a lot of output, so you'll want to pull up your terminal; there's an up arrow (**^**) on the right that makes it get much bigger.

Most of your tests will fail. This is good because you haven't done any work yet!

#### Do

Now you do the work! This is going to be a back and forth with google, What we tell you in the lab, and conversations with yourself and your notebook.

#### Save

Save your work, it won't do anything otherwise.

#### Test

Again, write, at the terminal:

> `python ../course/week1/tests.py`

Then press enter.

What did the tests say? What passed? What didn't?

The last two tests this week can't pass until you've pushed.

#### Commit

TODO: get some screenshots in here

#### Push

TODO: get some screenshots in here

#### Test

Hopefully, for the last time, write, at the terminal:

> `python ../course/week1/tests.py`

Then press enter.

What happens? Do you need to go back a few steps and have another go? If you can get a full suite of green ticks, then move onto Trinket

## Then: Trinket

Computing is mainly a mindset, not a typing skill. That mindset doesn't really care about languages. Programmers love to argue about which language is better, but in reality they have more in common than you'd think. The ideas cross boundaries.

Syntax, the way we type letters to make words and symbols, easy to get wrong. Let's start with an environment that makes the syntax easier.

Have a play with [trinket.io](https://hourofpython.trinket.io/from-blocks-to-code-with-trinket#/blocks/dragging-and-dropping) , follow the tutorial, or just try making the first letter of your name with a turtle, or even both!

### Homework

- Make sure that you have your dev environment set up.

- In the week1 folder, complete: - exercise1.py

- write your journal in README.md

  Check out [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for an intro to how formatting works in markdown (`.md`) files.

- That means that if you kept up in class, no homework this week! It's a great chance to read some of the articles below. They won't teach you python, but they _will_ broaden your mind.

In theory, you can't get a full set of green ticks without everything going right. If you get all the ticks, then you have finished your homework. _Don't_ leave class if you don't have a full set of green ticks
