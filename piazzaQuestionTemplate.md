# What is this?

It's a template post for you to use so that your issues get dealt with quickly and with minimal back-and-forth. Filling it in carefully will make it so much easier for me to get through lots of emails while still giving each of them the attention it deserves.

Make sure that you fill in the template carefully, and that you spell check it. This isn't because I'm some sort of grammar ogre, it signals to me that you care about my time enough to communicate clearly. This will make me feel disposed to do the same for you.

# The template

### useful title

My head is on fire [This is probably the same as the description below, just a bit shorter]

---

### Description of situation

My head is on fire

### What have you tried already?

- I have tried putting my head in the sand
- I have tried swimming in the sea
- I have looked at these questions on stack overflow:

  - [head extinguishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never_Gonna_Give_You_Up), this was about the other kind of head
  - [reset HEAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never_Gonna_Give_You_Up), this is about git, not hair

  but they didn't solve my problem

### What information would you like in the response

I assume, from your baldy head, that you have had an on-fire head before, what did you do about it?

### Link to your repo

Hi everyone,

Here's a polite, spell checked message to go with the information given above.

There shouldn't be _too_ much information here because it'll be mostly covered already.

Thanks
