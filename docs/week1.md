Attempt exercises in trinket.io if you have finished.

In the last hour we will familiarise ourselves with each bit of software we have installed and what purpose it serves in the course. After that we will cover how to write your lab books and push them to GitHub.

1.  Download anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section get the Python 3.7 version
1.  install it with default values _except_ tick the option to **Add Anaconda to my PATH**, tick that and the text will go red.
1.  Be patient
1.  Open anaconda navigator
1.  Click install on the VS Code box, be patient again
1.  Go to https://git-scm.com/downloads and download the latest git
1.  Install git with all the default values, except make vs code be the default editor
1.  restart vs code
1.  type [ctrl]+[`] that's a backtick, it's to the left of 1 on most keyboards
1.  Your prompt should say something like:
1.  `C:\Users\ben>` except where mine says `ben` yours will say something else, maybe it'll be your name, maybe it'll be something boring?
1.  type `mkdir 1161`
1.  then `cd 1161`
1.  then `git clone https://github.com/Design-Computing/CODE1161-2019 course`
1.  then `https://github.com/Design-Computing/courseOrg.git org`
1.  Go to https://github.com/Design-Computing/me and fork yourself a copy of the _me_ repo
1.  then `git clone https://github.com/`_your name_`/me.git`
1.  now type `dir` you should get something that looks like:

    ```
    C:\Users\ben\1161>dir

    01/06/2019  16:20    <DIR>          .
    01/06/2019  16:20    <DIR>          ..
    01/06/2019  16:20    <DIR>          course
    01/06/2019  16:20    <DIR>          org
    01/06/2019  16:20    <DIR>          me
                0 File(s)              0 bytes
                5 Dir(s)  308,818,493,440 bytes free

    C:\Users\ben\1161>
    ```

1.  Last thing: type `cd course` and then `./startup.bat` and press [enter] this will install some libraries and extensions that will make your life easier/more fun

1.  Now you're ready to start the lab for real!
